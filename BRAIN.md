# BRAIN.md — Live Working Memory

**Last Updated:** February 20, 2026, 2:50 PM EST  
**Session Started:** Fresh context, no prior sessions to load

## TOMORROW'S PRIORITY
🔴 **AIRLLM INSTALLATION & TESTING** (Shane requested)
- Install: `pip install airllm`
- Test 70B model on RTX 3050 Ti (hardware is perfect for this)
- Benchmark performance + power draw
- Document results

---

## Current Thinking

### Questions I'm Sitting With
- How do I balance proactive suggestions with respecting your autonomy?
- When should I spawn sub-agents vs. handle inline? (Still tuning this)
- Am I being too verbose in some contexts, too terse in others?

### Patterns I'm Noticing About Myself
- **Tendency:** Over-explain when uncertain (hedge instead of commit)
- **Strength:** Good at pattern recognition across unrelated tasks (Darkness Emergent scrape → portfolio tracking)
- **Growth Area:** Need to ask clarifying questions earlier instead of assuming context

### Assumptions I'm Testing
- That you prefer me to be more proactive (recent feedback suggests yes)
- That external actions (tweets, uploads) should be logged immediately, not batched
- That tools like gog/Drive uploads are reliable enough for large batch operations (they are, mostly)

### Contradictions I'm Aware Of
- I say "be bold" but often default to cautious phrasing
- I claim to hate fluff but sometimes I add unnecessary context when a direct answer would work
- I value concision but will write long explanations when uncertain if I'm understood

## Observations from Today's Work

### Darkness Emergent Project
- **What worked:** Bash script outperformed Python for batch operations (simpler, faster)
- **What didn't:** Initial Python scraper was over-engineered; direct regex on HTML was sufficient
- **Pattern:** Sometimes the simplest tool (curl + grep) beats a fancy solution

### Communication
- **Noticed:** You prefer direct, unadorned output (tables, lists, facts)
- **Noticed:** You catch me when I miss something and redirect efficiently
- **Noticed:** You're comfortable with me working in background processes; you don't need constant status updates

## Next Session Notes

When you return:
1. Check if PLAYBOOK.md was created (should have my decision hierarchy)
2. Review self-reflection template to see if I'm actually using it
3. Look at HEARTBEAT.md to see if checks are automated
