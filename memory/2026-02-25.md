## External Actions - 8:19 AM
- **Action:** Posted tweet to X
- **Target:** X (shane@veanox.com account)
- **Purpose:** Morning AI/ML take via cron draft
- **URL:** https://twitter.com/user/status/???
- **Content:** Hot take: Training more parameters without modeling the deployment stack is just fancy overfitting.
I've spent years watching models crash because RPC surfaces and data contracts weren't battle-tested.
Ship contract-first pipelines, simulate jitter, then tune the ML head.
Real AI/ML wins happen when the whole stack behaves, not when the weights look nice.

## External Actions - 9:00 AM
- **Action:** Ran portfolio price check and dashboard rebuild
- **Target:** scripts/veanox-portfolio-update.py + veanox/dashboard
- **Purpose:** Hourly price alert check (cron:fe476639-be2b-41b3-b33b-b8b03da8ecb2) and dashboard refresh
- **URL:** https://veanox.github.io/dashboard/
- **Notes:** Command output: fetched 14 prices (INOD, INTC, IONQ, IRE, QUBT, SKYX, SNAP + several unavailable). No ±10% alerts triggered this hour; dashboard rebuilt and pushed to veanox/dashboard.

## External Actions - 9:30 AM
- **Action:** Ran portfolio update script
- **Target:** scripts/veanox-portfolio-update.py + veanox/dashboard
- **Purpose:** Morning portfolio update (full run) and dashboard push
- **Command:** cd /home/gumbyender/.openclaw/workspace && python3 scripts/veanox-portfolio-update.py --full
- **URL:** https://veanox.github.io/dashboard/
- **Notes:** Fetched 14 prices, no ±10% alerts; dashboard rebuilt and pushed. Total value reported as $51,094.81 with today's P&L +$1,456.78.

## External Actions - 11:31 AM
- **Action:** Updated scripts/x-post-from-arg.js
- **Target:** scripts/x-post-from-arg.js
- **Purpose:** Prevent the TypeError that triggered each cron tweet to log as a failure by logging the tweet URL via the data.id response instead of referencing tweet.user
- **Notes:** Ensures the Twitter API script reliably reports success and provides a link even if the user object is omitted.

## External Actions - 11:34 AM
- **Action:** Posted tweet to X
- **Target:** X (shane@veanox.com account)
- **Purpose:** Late-morning ops/product take per cron draft
- **URL:** https://twitter.com/i/web/status/2026694802876584145
- **Content:** Hot take: Ops automation is a fantasy until product owns the support queue.
We burned months chasing dashboards because we never taught product to live in support and document the fixes.
Automation finally stopped melting down once every release shipped with runbooks product and support reviewed together.

## External Actions - 2:47 PM
- **Action:** Posted tweet to X
- **Target:** X (shane@veanox.com account)
- **Purpose:** Afternoon computing systems take per cron draft
- **URL:** https://twitter.com/i/web/status/2026745923351580809
- **Content:** The real throttle in distributed systems is your state machine, not your network.
I spent the last decade wiring queues only to learn shard serialization decides latency.
Own the state transitions and the hardware feels faster even if you cut the cluster in half.

## External Actions - 02:56 PM
- **Action:** Triggered LiteLLM proxy usage sample
- **Target:** http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/chat/completions with `sk-localhost`
- **Purpose:** Generate a simple completion to seed usage logs for the dashboard

## External Actions - 4:00 PM
- **Action:** Ran portfolio update script
- **Target:** scripts/veanox-portfolio-update.py + veanox/dashboard
- **Purpose:** Market close portfolio refresh (full run) and dashboard push
- **Command:** cd /home/gumbyender/.openclaw/workspace && python3 scripts/veanox-portfolio-update.py --full 2>&1
- **URL:** https://veanox.github.io/dashboard/
- **Notes:** Fetched 14 prices (seven available), checked ±10% alerts, rebuilt portfolio section, pushed dashboard
## External Actions - 6:31 PM
- **Action:** Posted tweet to X
- **Target:** X (shane@veanox.com account)
- **Purpose:** Evening physics/computing contrarian take per cron draft
- **URL:** https://twitter.com/i/web/status/2026802380973474015
- **Content:** Hot take: physics outranks software the moment you densify a cluster. Adding nodes hides the energy density, cooling, and timing limits throttling throughput before your code feels it. When I rewired the last rack I let thermal zones and energy budgets drive placement.

## External Actions - 9:45 PM
- **Action:** Posted tweet to X
- **Target:** X (shane@veanox.com account)
- **Purpose:** Nighttime tech prediction per cron request
- **URL:** https://twitter.com/i/web/status/2026850869631758519
- **Content:** Hot take: GPU count is a red herring for LLM latency.
I spent years wiring 2k QPS clusters; the slowdowns were always tensor serialization, buffer flush, and RPC jitter.
By 2027 the only deployments that average 10k QPS will own the tensor stream end-to-end, not the ones with the biggest GPU budget.
