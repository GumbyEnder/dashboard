# TODO — Friday, February 21, 2026

## Priority
- **🔴 AIRLLM INSTALLATION & TESTING**
  - Install AirLLM: `pip install airllm`
  - Verify CUDA toolkit (nvidia-smi)
  - Test 70B model on RTX 3050 Ti
  - Document results in memory
  - Draft amplification tweet connecting to physics + middleware insights

## Secondary
- Review last night's cron outputs (11:45 PM compounding engine + 11:59 PM dashboard)
- Choose between Typefully or Postiz for multi-platform posting (still pending)
- Check if PARA Second Brain indexing ran correctly

---

**Reminder:** Your hardware is PERFECT for AirLLM (4GB GPU = exactly what 70B needs). This should work.
