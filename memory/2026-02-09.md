## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Different accounts need different strategies:**
   - Personal accounts (gfmerch): Aggressive duplicate cleanup works great
   - Business accounts (skyplug): Conservative preservation + organization is key

2. **Shane's requirements are specific and important:**
   - Asked for folder organization, not deletion for business domains
   - Wants specific people organized (rani.kohen mentioned explicitly)
   - Values business email preservation over space savings

3. **Both approaches successful:**
   - gfmerch: 80.1% reduction (2,153 emails deleted)
   - skyplug: 1.9% reduction (262 spam deleted, business preserved)

## Shane's Response
- Approved first cleanup execution
- Clarified no deletions for skyplug domains
- Wanted folder organization instead
- Specifically mentioned rani.kohen folders

## Next Steps Ready
- Same methodologies can scale to remaining 6 accounts
- Mix of aggressive (personal) vs conservative (business) approaches
- Expected major impact on veanox.com (9.9 GB monster account)
