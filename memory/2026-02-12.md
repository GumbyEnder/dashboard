# Daily Memory - 2026-02-12

## System Recovery & Optimization
- Investigated downtime (<12h) caused by conflicting gateway services and D-Bus failures; implemented system-stability-fix + system-optimizer scripts.
- Added auto-healing monitor (15 min cron), enhanced logging/backups, resource tuning, and passwordless sudo for autonomous maintenance.

## Mission Control (ClawPad)
- Installed and launched ClawPad on port 3333 (proxied via 3334) to replace dashboard/crabwalk.
- Workspace functions (markdown pages in /home/gumbyender/clawd/pages/) but chat integration has a gateway-auth persistence bug (token wipes after reconnect).
- Per Shane's request, shut down ClawPad + proxy and deleted PM2 apps (shane-dashboard, crabwalk) so only core gateway remains.

## Communication Boundaries
- WhatsApp responses restricted to Shane's number (+14076877752) only.

## System Health Checks
- 3:00 PM process monitor: GOG 2, RAM 13.5%, swap 0%, zombies 0, total procs 410 (all normal).

## Stock Reports
- 12 PM report succeeded; 4 PM report failed due to finance-site scraping blocks. Need API (Alpha Vantage/IEX/Finnhub) or dedicated financial data skill for reliable closes.

## Outstanding Issues
- ClawPad chat auth bug (token not persisting); workspace is usable but chat integrates only temporarily.
- Need financial data source setup for future stock reports.
- Mission Control monitor cron (ID 70591cb1-f758-474f-9e50-0bdc9f5f7f0d) disabled after ClawPad shutdown to stop false outage alerts.
- Quiet hours set (10 PM–8 AM) — stay silent on WhatsApp unless Shane messages first.
