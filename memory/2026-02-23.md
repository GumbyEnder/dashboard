- **Purpose:** Physics/computing intersection contrarian take

- **Content:** Hot take: the next compute leap won't be another node in the cluster, it will be the first architecture that respects physics. I've watched teams squeeze schedulers while power density derailed them. Big O is noise when entropy budgets are overdrawn. Design stacks that move energy, not just bytes.

- **Content:** Hot take: The next platform war isn't about chips, it's about committed data contracts. Every time I inherit a stack I end up rebuilding the telemetry because nobody trusted each other to own the metrics. You can't scale AI writebacks if observability is just an afterthought. Build the contract and the rest of the stack follows.
