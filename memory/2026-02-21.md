Digital computing is burning the world for precision we do not need.

Neural networks run on similarity, not exactness. The brain is analog and noisy. Yet we force this onto digital silicon, then wonder why data centers gulp megawatts.

Analog computing will return. Not for everything, but for inference. Precision is a habit, not a requirement.

Cloud AI pricing is designed to make you forget that inference costs approach zero if you own the hardware.

A $2,000 workstation handles workloads that run $400/month in API fees. Do that math across 24 months. Then ask why you're renting compute you could own.

The quiet migration to local AI has already started.
