## Daily Monitoring Experiment - Day 2

### Morning Update (8:59 AM)
- **Request:** Shane asked for daily monitoring updates on the migration experiment
- **Status:** Providing first formal update
- **System Health:** Gateway stable, 17+ hours uptime since rebirth
- **Resource Usage:** 6.8GB/31GB RAM, normal load averages
- **Known Issues:** 2 zombie processes (gnome-online-ac defuncts) - inherited, harmless

### Goals
- Continue daily status reporting to Shane
- Monitor system stability with minimal service footprint
- Track any issues or improvements from the stripped-down approach

### 09:33 - Reor Knowledge Base Integration
- **Request:** Shane approved proceeding with Reor integration
- **Completed:** 
  - Copied all core workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, etc.)
  - Imported complete memory/ directory with daily logs and MEMORY.md
  - Added skills documentation
  - Created "Knowledge Base Overview.md" for navigation
- **Result:** Full OpenClaw workspace now available for semantic search and AI Q&A

### 09:35 - Shane's PC Specs & Future Project Discussion
**Shane's personal PC (not the host I'm running on):**
- **CPU:** Intel Core Ultra 9 285K (3.70 GHz)
- **RAM:** 64GB
- **GPU:** RTX 5080
- **Note:** Significantly more powerful than current host (RTX 3050 Ti, 31GB RAM)

**09:38 - Future Project Added:**
- **Project:** Extend OpenClaw to Shane's main PC
- **Scope:** Hybrid configuration - current host as "always-on server", main PC for "heavy lifting"
- **Considerations:** Gaming/work impact, resource management, smart model loading
- **Status:** Discussion postponed for future planning

### 09:38 - gogcli Tool Discovery
- **Link shared:** Shane shared t.co link to gogcli GitHub (steipete/gogcli)
- **Status:** I already have this tool available as the "gog" skill
- **Capability:** Full Google Workspace CLI access (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Sheets, Docs)
- **Next step:** Potential OAuth setup if Shane wants to use Google integrations

### 10:08 - WhatsApp Gateway Blip
- **Event:** WhatsApp gateway disconnected (status 499) at 10:08:35
- **Recovery:** Reconnected automatically at 10:08:38 (3-second outage)
- **Impact:** None - brief network hiccup, normal operation resumed
- **System Status:** Stable, same zombie count (2), no new issues

### 10:48 - gog Auth Status Check
- **Request:** Shane asked about gumbyender@gmail.com access
- **Finding:** gog partially configured - OAuth client exists but no accounts authorized
- **Status:** OAuth credentials stored (Feb 10), but no user tokens

### 10:50 - gog OAuth Configuration Issue
- **Action:** Started `gog auth add gumbyender@gmail.com` flow
- **Problem:** "Access blocked: Samwise Email Manager can only be used within its organization"
- **Cause:** OAuth app configured as "Internal" instead of "External" in Google Cloud Console
- **Solution needed:** Change OAuth consent screen to "External" or add as test user

### 11:02 - Google Drive Access Discovery
- **Shane's reminder:** "You have historically had access to my google drive"
- **Finding:** ✅ rclone `gdrive:` remote still works (tokens survived migration)
- **Status:** Google Drive access functional via rclone, Gmail/Calendar still need gog OAuth fix
- **Folders visible:** Personal/Samwise Bot/ folder confirmed accessible

### 11:03 - Drive Access Priority Confirmed
- **Shane:** "drive access is what matters most right now to me"
- **Status:** ✅ Drive fully functional, ready for operations
- **Available:** EMClient/EMClient2.0, archive, projects, secrets folders

### 11:50 - Large Web Verification Project
- **Scope:** ~100 web pages to verify against Google Doc (By Night Studios SRD)
- **Strategy:** Hybrid approach - Sonnet 4 coordination + Haiku sub-agents for bulk work
- **Status:** Google Doc link received, access issue encountered
- **Publisher:** bynightstudios.com (SRD = Structured Resource Document)

### 11:54 - Document Access Attempt
- **Document:** "Enemies of the Night SRD - Beta 1 to Beta 2" 
- **URL:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/15jcLeRCnTYwk2nwz3KNPo0_zZ75t58OZvqUuJr8ZbWI/
- **Issue:** OAuth tokens expired, can't access content directly
- **Shane:** Increased Claude budget for project
- **Options:** Make doc public, upload content, or fix OAuth first

### 12:32 - Browser Control Successfully Configured
- **Issue:** Shane asked how to get browser control working on Linux host
- **Root cause:** OpenClaw browser service not connected to gateway after restart  
- **Solution:** Restarted gateway + used openclaw profile (isolated browser)
- **Result:** ✅ Browser running (PID: 1640457, CDP port 18800)
- **SRD Access:** Successfully captured content from https://owod2.lovable.app/enemies-beta

### 12:43-12:54 - Google OAuth Setup Completed ✅
- **Project found:** "Samwise gangee" project under gumbyender@gmail.com
- **Client ID mismatch resolved:** Updated gog from old client to correct one (515683685900...)
- **OAuth flow completed:** gumbyender@gmail.com authenticated at 17:54:32Z
- **Services enabled:** Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Docs, Sheets
- **Major unlock:** Now have full Google Workspace access for SRD analysis

### 13:09 - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Source Document Captured ✅
- **Achievement:** Successfully accessed complete Google Doc content via gog
- **Document:** "Enemies of the Night SRD - Beta 1 to Beta 2" (By Night Studios)

  - Disciplines (Animalism, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Potence, Presence, Protean)
  - Loresheets (bloodlines, organizations)
  - Cults and Religions (4 categories, multiple groups)
  - Hecata Bloodlines (multiple families)
  - Merits and Flaws (connection, kindred types)
  - Predator Types (feeding styles)
- **Project status:** Both source and target materials now accessible for systematic comparison
- **Next phase:** Begin detailed markup analysis and change documentation

### 15:18 - OpenClaw Manual Update
- **Action:** Shane manually updated OpenClaw 
- **Version:** 2026.2.9 → 2026.2.13 (203b5bd)
- **Method:** Manual installation (not via update command)
- **Status:** HEARTBEAT.md updated to reflect current version

### Notes
