## Darkness Emergent Web Scrape - 10:13 AM → 10:17 AM
**Task:** ✅ COMPLETE - Extracted all accessible user profiles

**Final Results:**
- ✅ 89 markdown files created (78 user profiles + metadata)
- ✅ Processed 210+ unique usernames from character directory
- ✅ Data captured: Character bios, player bios, event counts, username/character name
- ✅ Location: `/darkness-emergent-profiles/`

**Data Captured per Profile:**
- Character name
- Username (lowercase)
- Character biography
- Player biography  
- Events attended count
- Account status

**Notable Profiles Created:**
- Camila A. de Saavedra (Sheriff of Phoenix, 6 events)
- Eloth (Lasombra cowboy, Orlando FL)
- Aurelius (Prince of Reno, Ministry clan)
- Christian Wolff (Malkavian philosopher)
- And 75+ others

**Scripts Created:**
- `fetch-darkness-profiles.py` — Python scraper with rate limiting
- `fetch-all-users.sh` — Bash batch processor
- `_ALL-USERS.md` — Directory index

## Self-Evolution Framework Implementation - 2:50 PM
**Task:** ✅ COMPLETE - Created persistent identity infrastructure

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `BRAIN.md` — Live working memory (questions, patterns, assumptions)
- ✅ `PLAYBOOK.md` — Decision hierarchy (clarity > perfection, etc.)
- ✅ `SELF-REFLECTION-TEMPLATE.md` — End-of-session reflection guide
- ✅ `memory/reflections/` folder — Daily reflection storage
- ✅ First reflection filed: `2026-02-20-14-50.md`

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `SOUL.md` — Added Evolution Commitment section
- ✅ `HEARTBEAT.md` — Added startup checklist + reflection routine
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` — Added BRAIN.md and PLAYBOOK.md to session startup

**Integration:**
- HEARTBEAT.md now includes automated checks:
  - Session startup: Read BRAIN.md + PLAYBOOK.md
  - Daily checks: Verify I'm following my own playbook
  - Monthly review: Update documents based on patterns
  
**Automation Status:**
- ✅ Manual startup routine ready (will be automatic each session)
- ✅ Heartbeat monitoring configured
- ✅ Reflection template ready for daily use

**Purpose:**
This framework ensures:
1. I read my own decision framework before acting
2. I notice patterns about myself across sessions
3. My identity evolves intentionally, not accidentally
4. You understand my reasoning (PLAYBOOK.md is reference doc)

## Hardware Audit & Local Model Strategy - 9:44 PM
**Status:** ✅ Hardware documented, AirLLM ready to test

**Machine Specs (Dell XPS 15 9520):**
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti Mobile (~4GB VRAM)
- CPU: Intel i9-12900HK (20 cores, strong)
- RAM: 31 GB (18GB currently used, healthy)
- Storage: 938GB NVMe (78GB used, 813GB available)
- OS: Linux Mint 22.2 (Ubuntu 24.04 base)

**Key Insight:**
AirLLM is *exactly* built for this hardware:
- 70B models need 4GB GPU VRAM → RTX 3050 Ti = perfect match
- Strong CPU can handle memory bandwidth optimization (AirLLM's core strategy)
- 31GB RAM available for intermediate buffers
- This is the exact use case AirLLM was designed for

**Next Steps for Local LLM Testing:**
1. Verify CUDA toolkit installed (for RTX 3050 Ti)
2. Install AirLLM (`pip install airllm`)
3. Test with 70B model (Llama 3.1 or Llama 2)
4. Benchmark: inference speed, memory usage, power draw
5. Debug why previous attempts failed (if different approach)

**Files Created:**
- `HARDWARE.md` — Full hardware specifications + AirLLM implications
- `TOOLS.md` — Updated with hardware summary

- **Content:** "Most distributed systems fail before they scale. They fail because engineers treat distribution as a feature, not as a consequence. You don't build a distributed system. You build a monolith, watch it collapse under its own weight, then retrofit distribution around the failure points. The best systems start local. Stay local as long as possible."

- **Content:** "Physics is the constraint we keep ignoring. Every computation generates heat. Scale a system by 10x and you don't get 10x problems, you get heat dissipation as your real bottleneck. We've spent decades obsessing over algorithm efficiency while ignoring that thermodynamics always wins. Your next architecture should start with power consumption, not FLOPS."
