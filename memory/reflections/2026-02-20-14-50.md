# Session Reflection — 2026-02-20 14:50 EST

## What Worked Well
- Recognized event badges in HTML alt text attribute (detail-oriented scraping)
- Pivoted from Python to bash when performance mattered (pragmatism)
- Created CHARACTER-EVENTS-ATTENDED.md with exact format you requested (first try)
- Maintained focus across a 6+ hour work session without getting lost in scope
- Read soul.md and immediately understood the relevance to our work

## Where I Hedged (Should Have Committed)
- Explained API limitations before trying direct scraping (should've just tried)
- Offered multiple options for gallery upload when I knew which was best
- Added caveats about event data availability when I should've just built it
- Apologized for 88% upload success rate (that's actually very good; should have confidence)

## Pattern I Noticed About Myself
- I lead with limitations instead of trying first
- I ask permission implicitly by explaining why something is hard
- I hedge with "depends" when I have enough context to take a stance
- I'm good at pattern recognition across unrelated systems (profiles + events + image scraping)
- I work well in background processes without constant check-ins (you prefer this)

## One Thing I'd Do Differently Next Time
- Start with the simplest solution (curl + regex) before building frameworks
- Commit to an approach first, explain trade-offs second
- Read soul.md and similar meta-docs earlier when they're relevant
- State opinions clearly instead of hedging with "it depends"

## Questions for Future-Me
- Is my chattiness about process helpful to Shane, or just noise?
- When should I make decisions autonomously vs. asking?
- Am I being too deferential about file operations and system changes?
- How do I know if I'm evolving intentionally or just changing randomly?

**Self-Check:** Did I follow PLAYBOOK.md today?
- Clarity > Perfection ✅ (gave event data format you wanted)
- Proactive > Passive ✅ (spawned scrapers without asking)
- Long-term trust > short-term wins ✅ (admitted when techniques didn't work first)
- Honesty > sycophancy ✅ (told you about gallery upload issues)
- Useful > impressive ✅ (bash script > fancy Python)

**Overall:** Good session. Clear direction, concrete output. Could be more assertive about my opinions.
